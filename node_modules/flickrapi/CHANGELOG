v0.2.14
  * downsync will now prune entries that you removed from Flickr,
    but still have in your mirror, but only when the `downsync`
    function is called with the option second `removeDeleted`
    parameter set to `true`.

v0.2.11
  * updated the progress package. It's now well-behaved on OSX.

v0.2.9

  * photos are correctly sorted in photosets

v0.2.6
  * comments and contexts are cross-referenced into photos

v0.2.5
  * functions calls are always correctly auth'd
  * app permissions can be passed during the `authenticate` call,
    defaulting to "read".

  * photos now indicate the image sizes that Flickr has for them
